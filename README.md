Flipit
======

Flipboard Flipit unofficial extension for Chrome.  This extension basically takes the bookmarklet created from the Flipboard site and encapsulates it into a Chrome extension.  I really don't like exposing the extra row of bookmarks in my browser, so I wrote this extension so that i could use the bookmarklet from the toolbar.
